# Advanced Exoplanet-Explorer
The "Advanced Exoplanet Explorer" project represents an ambitious initiative to create an interactive, web-based platform tailored for both researchers and exoplanet enthusiasts. The primary objective of this project is to facilitate the analysis and exploration of exoplanetary data in a manner that is both comprehensive and accessible. Through this platform, users will have the opportunity to delve into the fascinating world of exoplanets, expanding their understanding and contributing to scientific discovery.

Central to the platform's functionality is the visualization of stellar light curves. This important feature allows users to observe and interpret variations in light intensity from distant stars, which may indicate the presence of exoplanets. By providing clear and detailed visualizations, the platform enables users to easily identify and analyze these variations, which are crucial for detecting potential exoplanet transits.
Moreover, the platform incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques, with a particular emphasis on Random Forest classifiers. These algorithms are employed to enhance the detection accuracy of potential exoplanet transits. By automating the classification process, the platform not only speeds up the analysis but also ensures a higher level of precision, making it a valuable tool for researchers and enthusiasts alike.
